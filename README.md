# Kodi Angular

This is a web interface for the entertainment center [Kodi](http://kodi.tv/) (formerly known as XBMC), using AngularJS framework.

There is already plenty of web interfaces available for Kodi, I just wanted to make my own, for fun!

It uses [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) for the design, therefore it is fully responsive.

## Installation

You need to install XBMC 12.0 or upper, as it uses [Kodi JSON-RPC API v6](http://kodi.wiki/view/JSON-RPC_API) through WebSocket technology.

You also need to install __Bower__ for packages dependencies, and __Grunt__.

## Available features

This project is far from being finished!

For now, it integrates :

- remote control (move, back, home button...)
- volume
- List available movies
